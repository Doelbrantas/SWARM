# SWARM 3.2.8

## Improvements:
* Removed amdmeminfo error output in linux. (it wasn't issue- just annoying).
* Output warning if HiveOS keys in Windows are corrupted (likely due to bad
  reconnection). Prevent using corrupted keys to help re-sync with HiveOS.
* Default OpenCL platform to "0" if auto-detection fails. 90% of the time
  it is 0 anyways.
