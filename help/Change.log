# SWARM 3.4.2

## Note
* This is a pre-release for users to test new added pool. I have will have a full update with miners in near future.

## What's New?
* New PPS Pool: Hashrent.pro added.
* Hashrent is a Ethash Pay-Per-Share pool in which testing seems competitive against nicehash.
* Hashrent is a PPS, meaning great for switching between pools. Hashrent pays in BTC (Auto-Exchange).
* Hashrent is beta/expiremental.
* Hashrent requires a user account made.
* Hashrent requires -SuperWallet argument. This is supplied by their site, and is the Pegas Superprofit wallet.
* Hashrent requires -HashrentInstance instance argument. When you create a farm, this is instance number of farm.
* An example of -HashrentInstance would be: -HashrentInstance 001 for first farm.
* New argument for hashrent: -SuperWallet created
* New argument for hashrent: -HashrentInstance created
* hashrent not added to initial swarm_help- Will add after confirmed no issues. Must add manually.

## Improvements
* Move fancyIX to optional miners- Old, and no longer developed. Fails on most recent cards.
* Hashrate from miners.ps1 forced as decimal & 0 value instead of null (was causing minor errors occasionally).
* Fix issue with miners not launching when ran through debugging software.
* Tagging now updates with profit/day from total rig, not just group1 i.e. (NVIDIA1 + CPU) or (AMD1 + NVIDIA2). Still shows only miner and pool from group 1 though.
* BCD removed from cryptodredge- Missed it is was no longer supported.
