# SWARM 3.3.6

## Note
* If you are using new tagging feature, and tags are missing on HiveOS display, reload page. It's not bug, just how tagging works.

## What's New?
* User suggested to updated BTC\Day each time database loads, not just when miners switch. This was implemented.
* -API_Key will allow users to view current miner, profit, and pool through HiveOS tagging system.
* -API_Key should be an account API access token, which you can generate in the "account" section of your farm.
* tagging.psm1 was created.
* Seperated HiveOS tagging and octune features of SWARM- Tagging happen after all miners launch now, not before.
* Cleaned up codebase around tagging to make easier to read/debug.
