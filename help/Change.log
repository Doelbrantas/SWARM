# SWARM 3.2.8

## Critical Changes
* Improved memory concerns over long term/running usage.
* This is a larger change- Bugs may be present. Please let
  me know if you experience any.

## Improvements
* Removed amdmeminfo error output in linux. (it wasn't issue- just annoying).
* Output warning if HiveOS keys in Windows are corrupted (likely due to bad reconnection). Prevent using corrupted keys to help re-sync with HiveOS.
* Default OpenCL platform to "0" if auto-detection fails. 90% of the time it is 0 anyways.
* Remove randomx on nanominer. Was using cpu instead of GPU.
* Fix downloading miners that place their file in a different folder name.
* Wilrdig- Added parameter to specifiy multiple instances for AMD/NVIDIA hybrid rigs.
* Windows Autofan- Shortened loop speed, so it will execute fan changes faster.
