# SWARM 3.4.6

## What's New?
  * Ubqhash added (zergpool)
  * (Auto_Algo) SWARM will NOT add algorithms with 0 current hashrate on pool to list. Will still add for Auto_Coin

## Improvements
  * Better opencl detection. If it doesn't detect your platform number correctly- use -CLPlatform. SWARM uses clinfo to determine platform.
  * (Windows) Output warning if NVSMI folder creation fails.
  * Srbmulti: Remove AMDmemTweak auto settings. Potential to cause issues with modded bioses.
  * Fixed a lot of issues with zergpool ethash/equihash/kawpow and miners that were not settting extra parameters correctly. This mainly affected Auto_Coin.

## Updates
* xmrig updated
* lolminer updated (still testing ethash for all pools/settings/arguments).
* t-rex updated
* wildrig updated
* nanominer updated
* srbmulti updated
* gminer updated
