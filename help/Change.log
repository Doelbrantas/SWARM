# SWARM 3.3.5

## What's New?
* Using -API_Key argument, SWARM will now display Profit/Day as a tag along with pool and miner.
* -API_Key is an account API access token, which you can generate in the "account" section of your farm.
* VERY IMPORTANT: IF USING -API_Key, MAKE SURE ALL WORKERS IN FARM HAVE DIFFERENT WORKER NAME!

## Improvements
* Fix Miner uptime issue.
